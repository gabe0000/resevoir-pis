# RF-20260301-002: Debugging And Restabilization

## Phase C: Stabilization
Observed documentation risks during rollout:
- drift between private canonical docs and public projection after fast runtime patch cycles
- repeated confusion around transport metadata versus authorization identity
- uneven visibility into where storage and expertise workflows were governed

Stabilization actions:
- added direct public docs for HQ structure and memory governance
- made channel-index anti-pattern explicit in contracts and validator checks
- added mapping rows that link private canonical docs to public equivalents

Residual risk:
- ongoing runtime changes can outpace public projection if sync cadence is not enforced.
