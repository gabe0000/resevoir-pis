# RF-20260301-002: Context And Goals

## Phase A: Baseline (Before)
- Documentation had strong governance scaffolding but needed a formal HQ-era model across private and public repos.
- Existing runtime state was semi-stable and actively being restabilized while docs were evolving.
- The Office/Library/Desk concept was used operationally but not fully codified as a public architecture baseline.

## Goals
- publish a clear HQ layout and Office/Library/Desk model for onboarding and handoff
- document become-an-expert behavior as a gated, bounded contract
- tie refactor records to baseline and final verified phases
- keep public docs safe while still useful for future agent bootstrap work
