# RF-20260301-002: Verification And Known Risks

## Verification
- required refactor bundle files exist
- new HQ architecture/contract/runbook docs exist
- `PUBLIC_DOCS_MAP` includes HQ-era mapping rows
- validator enforces bundle + phase + mapping checks

## Phase D: Final Verified State (After)
- public docs now expose a clear HQ model and Office/Library/Desk boundaries
- become-an-expert behavior is documented with allowlist and bounded storage rules
- public validation gates now fail if this refactor bundle or mapping rules are missing

## Known risks
- public projection quality still depends on disciplined private-first update cadence
- narrative docs may lag runtime unless each infra wave includes immediate docs updates
