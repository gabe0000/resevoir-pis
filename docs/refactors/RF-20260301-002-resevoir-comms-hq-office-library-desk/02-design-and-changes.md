# RF-20260301-002: Design And Changes

## Phase B: Implementation
This public projection includes:
- HQ layout architecture page
- plain-English Office/Library/Desk architecture page
- become-an-expert contract page
- library memory management runbook
- refactor bundle for this HQ-era wave
- map and validator updates to enforce projection completeness

Design goals:
- keep stock and custom wire contracts stable
- keep sensitive access details out of public docs
- keep private->public mapping explicit and traceable
